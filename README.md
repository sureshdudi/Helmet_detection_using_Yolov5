# Helmet detection using Yolo_v5
I am used yolo_v3 and yolo_v4 for cotton detection in 2020.                                                                                                                        
I always wanted to try yolo_v5 as many articles stated it is really fast.                                                                                                         
I got dataset from from roboflow 

#Observations:
Yolo_v5 is really fast compared to previous models it took just 5-6 hours to train 5269 images.
Where as it took nearly 1 day to train 120 images in yolo_v3 during cotton detection
I used google colab for training both the models
Accuracy and size of models it gives at the end training was also amazing
Finally, Yolo_v5 was wonderful algorithm which can be used for any object detection problem with ease and gives best results in less time compared to its previous versions
